# Google Analytics With "react-ga4" lybrary: 

- Google Analytics ID:

  import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID is used to securely fetch the Google Analytics Measurement ID from environment variables. This is typically done to avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys      directly in the codebase. Environment variables like VITE_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID are defined in a .env file or other configuration files.
  
- Tracking ID:

  TRACKING_ID stores the Google Analytics Measurement ID fetched from the environment. This ID is unique to your Google Analytics property and is used to send data to the correct account.
  
- Initializing Google Analytics:

  ReactGA.initialize(TRACKING_ID) initializes Google Analytics in your React application. This step is necessary before you can start tracking page views, events, or other interactions. It essentially connects your   app with the Google Analytics service using the provided Measurement ID.

          useEffect(() => {
            ReactGA.send("pageview"); // Track initial page load
          }, []);
- Explanation:
  
  - useEffect Hook:

    The useEffect hook in React is used to run side effects in functional components. Here, it ensures that the ReactGA.send("pageview") function is called once, right after the component is mounted.
    
  - Tracking Page Views:
    
    ReactGA.send("pageview") sends a "pageview" event to Google Analytics. This tells Google Analytics that the user has loaded a page in your application. Typically, you would use this to track which pages users     visit and how often.

- Tracking a Custom Event:
  
                ReactGA.event({
                    category: "User Login",
                    action: `${loginData.username} Clicked on Login Button`,
                    label: "Login Button",
                });
    - Custom Event Tracking:
        ReactGA.event() is used to track specific user interactions that don't fall under standard page views, such as button clicks, form submissions, video plays, etc. This provides more detailed insights into           user behavior.
    - Event Object Properties:
        category: "User Login" - The category groups events together. This could be related to user actions, specific sections of your app, or any logical grouping. Here, it groups all events related to user               login.

      action: ${loginData.username} Clicked on Login Button - The action describes what the user did. In this case, it logs that the user with a specific username clicked on the login button.

      label: "Login Button" - The label is an optional field that provides additional context. It can describe the element that was interacted with or provide more detail on the event. Here, it labels the event         as being related to the "Login Button."


- Common Methods and Properties of ReactGA:
        Here's a brief overview of the most commonly used methods and what they do:

  - initialize(trackingId, options?):

      Initializes Google Analytics with the provided trackingId.
      options is an optional object where you can pass additional configurations like setting debug mode, etc.
      Example:
    
            ReactGA.initialize('UA-000000-01', { debug: true });
    - send(fieldsObject):

      Sends data to Google Analytics. For example, send("pageview") is commonly used to track page views.
      Example:

              ReactGA.send({ hitType: 'pageview', page: '/home' });
    - pageview(path):

      A shortcut for sending pageview events. It tracks when a user visits a specific page.
      Example:

              ReactGA.pageview('/home');
    -  event(eventObject):

        Tracks specific interactions like button clicks, form submissions, etc.
        Example:

               ReactGA.event({
                category: 'User',
                action: 'Created an Account',
                label: 'Signup Button'
              });
    -  What Happens When You console.log(ReactGA)?
        When you run console.log(ReactGA), it will print the ReactGA object with all the available methods like initialize, send, pageview, event, and so on.
        You'll see the function definitions and other properties within ReactGA. This can be useful if you're exploring the library or debugging.
